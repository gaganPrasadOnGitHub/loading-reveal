# Loading Reveal

This project demonstrates the use of `setInterval` and `clearInterval` for a loading screen effect where the background gradually fades out as the percentage text progresses from 0% to 100%.

## Usage:

- Include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your project.
- Adjust the animation duration by changing the `duration` variable in `index.js`.
- Run the project in a browser to see the loading animation in action.
